Q.4)

Write a function sublsum in Racket that takes a list (of integers) as input and returns
a list of sublists of it that sum to zero. For this problem, you can use the
combinations built-in function. Note the order of the sublists and their elements
doesnâ€™t matter. For example:
> (sublsum (list 1 2 3 4 -5))
'((2 3 -5) (-5 1 4))
> (sublsum (list 1 2 3 4 5))
'()
